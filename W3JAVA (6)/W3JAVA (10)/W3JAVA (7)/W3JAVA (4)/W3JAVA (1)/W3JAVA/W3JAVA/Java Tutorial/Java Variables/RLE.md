# Java Variables - Examples

## Real-Life Examples

Often in our examples, we simplify variable names to match their data type (myInt or myNum for ```int``` types, myChar for ```char``` types, and so on). This is done to avoid confusion.

However, for a practical example of using variables, we have created a program that stores different data about a college student:

Example

```java
// Student data
String studentName = "John Doe";
int studentID = 15;
int studentAge = 23;
float studentFee = 75.25f;
char studentGrade = 'B';

// Print variables
System.out.println("Student name: " + studentName);
System.out.println("Student id: " + studentID);
System.out.println("Student age: " + studentAge);
System.out.println("Student fee: " + studentFee);
System.out.println("Student grade: " + studentGrade);
```

## Calculate the Area of a Rectangle

In this real-life example, we create a program to calculate the area of a rectangle (by multiplying the length and width):

Example

```java
// Create integer variables
int length = 4;
int width = 6;
int area;

// Calculate the area of a rectangle
area = length * width;

// Print variables
System.out.println("Length is: " + length);
System.out.println("Width is: " + width);
System.out.println("Area of the rectangle is: " + area);
```
