# Java Output Numbers
## Print Numbers
You can also use the ```println()``` method to print numbers.

However, unlike text, we don't put numbers inside double quotes:<br>
Example
```
System.out.println(3);
System.out.println(358);
System.out.println(50000);
```
You can also perform mathematical calculations inside the ```println()``` method:<br>
Example
```
System.out.println(3 + 3);
```
Example
```

System.out.println(2 * 5);
```
