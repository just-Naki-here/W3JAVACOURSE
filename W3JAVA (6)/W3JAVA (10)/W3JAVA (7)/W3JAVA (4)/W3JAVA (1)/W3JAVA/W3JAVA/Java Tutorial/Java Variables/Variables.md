# Java Variables

## Java Vars

Variables are containers for storing data values.

In Java, there are different **types** of variables, for example:

* ```String``` - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
* ```int``` - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
* ```float``` - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
* ```char``` - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
* ```boolean``` - stores values with two states: true or false
  
## Declaring (Creating) Variables

To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value:

Syntax

```java
type variableName = value;

```

Where type is one of Java's types (such as ```int``` or ```String```), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as **x** or **name**). The **equal sign** is used to assign values to the variable.

To create a variable that should store text, look at the following example:

Example
Create a variable called name of type String and assign it the value "**John**".
Then we use ```println()``` to print the **name** variable:

```java
String name = "John";
System.out.println(name);
```

To create a variable that should store a number, look at the following example:

Example
Create a variable called **myNum** of type ```int``` and assign it the value **15**:

```java
int myNum = 15;
System.out.println(myNum);
```

You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later:

Example

```java
int myNum;
myNum = 15;
System.out.println(myNum);
```

Note that if you assign a new value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value:

Example

Change the value of ```myNum``` from ```15``` to ```20```:

```java
int myNum = 15;
myNum = 20;  // myNum is now 20
System.out.println(myNum);
```

## Final Variables

If you don't want others (or yourself) to overwrite existing values, use the ```final``` keyword (this will declare the variable as "final" or "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only):
Example

```java
final int myNum = 15;
myNum = 20;  // will generate an error: cannot assign a value to a final variable
```

## Other Types

A demonstration of how to declare variables of other types:

Example

```java
int myNum = 5;
float myFloatNum = 5.99f;
char myLetter = 'D';
boolean myBool = true;
String myText = "Hello";
```
