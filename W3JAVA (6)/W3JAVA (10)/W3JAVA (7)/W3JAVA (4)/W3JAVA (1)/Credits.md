all content comes from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools.comwhich means I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Just_NVLL_here">Naki</a> do not own any of this content, I am just making it more public and easier to access.
If you ever use this as a source, don't credit me, credit W3Schools instead.
I DO NOT tolerate this source to be used for illegal stuff, EVER
